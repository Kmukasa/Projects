# Luganda Dictionary

## Aim
The Luganda Dictionary Project is my way of finding a fun and interactive way to learn my mother tongue, luganda. The journey started because I was looking to google translate to find translations to a lugdana word I had heard in a song. I didn't find any option for luganda on google trnaslate. All the other dictionary options were simple text based html webpages or apps that didn't work. So I decided I should try and make my own. I'm a computer science major interested in learning how to make web and mobile applications, so I saw a perfect learning opportunity here. And thus the luganda dictionary was born.
